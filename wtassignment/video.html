				<p>Mawlynnong, located in Meghalaya, is called “God’s own Garden” and has enough reasons for that. It was awarded the title “cleanest village in Asia” by Discover India in 2003. Cleanliness must be its most important aspect, but it has achieved so much more than that. From a full hundred percent literacy rate to a highly progressive scenario for women, it has struck all the correct chords.Mawlynnong has a pleasant weather all throughout the year.  Nevertheless, It’s best time to visit is in the monsoons.</p>
